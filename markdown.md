Cloud computing has transformed the way we store, manage, and access data. It provides scalable, on-demand access to computing resources over the internet — often referred to as "the cloud".

## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing allows individuals and organizations to use computing resources on the internet such as server ,storage ,databases, networking ,software analytics

Instead of owning and maintaining physical data centers or servers, users can rent access to:

- Virtual Machines
- Databases
- Storage Systems
- Software Platforms

## Types of Cloud Services

Cloud services are typically categorized into three main models:

### 1.IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.  
Examples:

- Amazon Web Services (AWS)  
- Google Compute Engine  
- Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines  

### 2.PaaS (Platform as a Service)

Delivers software applications over the internet, on a subscription basis.  
Examples:

- Google Workspace (Docs, Sheets)  
- Dropbox  
- Salesforce  

## Benefits of Cloud Computing

- ✅ Scalability – Easily scale resources up or down  
- ✅ Cost Efficiency – Pay only for what you use  
- ✅ Accessibility – Access from anywhere with internet  
- ✅ Reliability – Built-in redundancy and backup systems 
- ✅ security – any type of data can be encrypted in safer
